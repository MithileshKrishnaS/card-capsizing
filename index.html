                <h2>Gyomei Himejima</h2>
                <p id="para">Gyomei is a hulking figure among the Demon Slayers. He is one of the tallest characters in the series,
                    easily towering over his fellow Hashira. He is powerfully built and extremely muscular. He has spiky black hair
                    and a prominent scar running horizontally across his forehead. Having been blind since childhood, 
                    he has white eyes with no visible irises or pupils. His eyes frequently tear-up when he gets emotional.</p>
